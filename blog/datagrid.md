# JavaScript Data Grid vs Data Table

When discussing web components, terms like **Data Grid** and **Data Table** often overlap.
This confusion arises due to existing web technologies and component behaviors:

- [**Data Table**](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/tables.html) is a basic HTML element used to display tabular data with some interactive features.
- **Data Grid** provides a highly interactive, customizable grid layout, spreadsheet-like experience.

## HTML Tables vs. Data Grids

### HTML Tables
Traditionally, tables were used to display data in rows and columns:

```html
<table>
   <tr><th>Make</th><th>Color</th><th>Price</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Mercedes</td><td>Black</td><td>$25,300</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Mazda</td><td>Green</td><td>$29,200</td></tr>
</table>
```

**Limitations of HTML Tables:**
- Render all data at once (inefficient for large datasets).
- Depend on page scrolling for navigation.
- Limited interactivity without JavaScript.

### CSS HTML Grids
CSS Grid solves layout issues but is not designed for rendering data dynamically.

**Key Difference:** CSS Grid structures a page, while a Data Grid handles dynamic, interactive data rendering.

### Data Grid

A Data Grid is a UI component designed for displaying and interacting with large datasets in a structured, tabular format. Unlike traditional HTML tables, a Data Grid supports advanced features such as:

- Virtual scrolling for handling thousands of rows efficiently.
- Sorting, filtering, and pagination for enhanced usability.
- In-cell editing to modify data directly within the grid.
- Column and row pinning for better data organization.
- Custom renderers and editors to extend grid functionalities.

Data Grids are widely used in enterprise applications, analytics dashboards, and financial platforms where users need high-performance, real-time data interactions.

### Data Grid vs. Data Table

| Feature           | Data Table | Data Grid  |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Uses `<table>`   | ✅        | ❌ (uses `<div>` for flexibility) |
| Sorting         | ✅        | ✅ (built-in) |
| Filtering       | ❌ (requires manual setup) | ✅ (single-line config) |
| Virtualization  | ❌ (needs extra libraries) | ✅ (out-of-the-box) |
| Cell Editing    | ❌ (custom implementation required) | ✅ (built-in, extensible) |
| Column Pinning  | ❌        | ✅ |
| Row Selection   | ✅ (basic) | ✅ (advanced: multi-row, range selection) |
| Exporting       | ❌ (third-party needed) | ✅ (supports Excel, CSV) |

## When to Use a Data Grid?

A **Data Grid** like RevoGrid is ideal when you need:
- **High-performance rendering** for large datasets.
- **Customizable user interactions** (editing, sorting, filtering, etc.).
- **Enterprise-grade features** like live updates, aggregation, and pivoting.
- **Minimal setup** with configuration over manual coding.


## RevoGrid is a Data Grid

RevoGrid is a **high-performance** Data Grid built for tabular data visualization. It provides rich interactivity with minimal configuration and is compatible with **React, Vue, Angular, and JavaScript**.


It is designed for modern web applications that need efficient and interactive tabular data management. Unlike traditional **Data Tables**, RevoGrid offers:

- **Virtual scrolling** for handling thousands of rows seamlessly.
- **Real-time updates** with cell flashing and dynamic calculations.
- **Custom renderers** for tailored data presentation.
- **Advanced row/column interactions** like multi-selection and row expansion.
- **Excel-like functionalities**, including formula support and data export.

## Should You Build Your Own Data Grid?
Building a custom Data Grid is **time-consuming and complex**. If your use case is simple (e.g., sorting a static table), a DIY approach might work. However, for advanced features and performance optimization, using a proven library like **RevoGrid** saves time and effort while ensuring reliability.

## Conclusion: Data Grid or Data Table?
