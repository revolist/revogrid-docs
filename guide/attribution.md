# Considering Removing the Attribution? 🤔

If you’re thinking about removing the attribution, we’d first like to mention:

**If you’re using RevoGrid at your organization and making money from it, we rely on your support to keep RevoGrid developed and maintained under an MIT License.** Before you remove the attribution, see [the ways you can support RevoGrid](../pro/) to keep it running.

Are you using RevoGrid for a **personal project**? Awesome! 🎉 Go ahead and remove the attribution. You can support us by:
- Reporting any bugs 🐞 you find
- Sending us screenshots 📸 of your projects
- Starring us ⭐ on [GitHub](https://github.com/revolist/revogrid)

If you start making money using RevoGrid or use it in an organization in the future, we would ask that you re-add the attribution or sign up for our [Pro membership](../pro/).

**Thank you for supporting the RevoGrid team!** ✌🏻
