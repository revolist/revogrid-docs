# Pagination in Data Grids

Managing large datasets in a data grid can be challenging, but with [Pro Version](../pro/index.md) Pagination Plugin, you can break down your data into smaller, more manageable pages. This not only enhances performance but also improves the user experience by making navigation through data simpler and more intuitive.

## How does it work?

Pagination allows you to divide your dataset into discrete pages, each containing a specified number of rows. Users can then navigate through these pages rather than scrolling through a long list of data.

This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets where loading all rows at once could affect performance.

## Enabling Pagination

To enable pagination in RevoGrid, you'll need to use the `PaginationPlugin` from Pro version. This plugin provides the necessary functionality to paginate data within the grid.

## Benefits of Pagination

- **Efficient Data Loading**: Pagination helps reduce the number of rows that need to be loaded into the grid, which can improve performance (If you have huge number of calculations, it can be a challenge).
- **Improved Performance**: By loading only a subset of data at a time, pagination helps maintain grid performance even with large datasets.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can easily navigate through data without being overwhelmed by a large number of rows.
- **Customizable**: The Pagination Plugin is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor the pagination behavior to your specific needs.
