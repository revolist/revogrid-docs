# Data Grid Width/Height

Working with other data grid systems you probably looking for a way to setup width or height for grid viewport.
Good news it'll be updated automatically. All you have todo just change size of your table with css.

Be aware that there is a min-height of `300px` in the default data grid. It's just to avoid the grid to be too small.
