## Why Use Custom Cell Rendering?

RevoGrid’s native cell rendering enables you to:
-	**Embed Components**: Render complex or interactive UI elements inside grid cells, such as buttons, images, input fields, or custom widgets.
-	**Dynamic Content**: Customize each cell’s content based on the data it represents, such as formatting or conditional rendering.
-	**Interactivity**: Make cells interactive with event listeners and component lifecycle methods, improving the overall user experience.
