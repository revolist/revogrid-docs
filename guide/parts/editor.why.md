## Why Use Custom Editors?

With native editor rendering, you can:
- **Customize the Editing Experience**: Use any React component as a custom editor, providing a tailored user interface for editing data directly in the grid.
- **Build Complex Editors**: Embed interactive elements such as date pickers, dropdowns, or custom forms inside cells, which would be impossible with simple input fields alone.
- **Improve Usability**: Create inline editors that match your applicationâ€™s UI, improving consistency and enhancing the overall user experience.
