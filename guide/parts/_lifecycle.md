## Lifecycle Hooks

For detailed interactions and operations, RevoGrid provides a variety of [events](./api/revoGrid.md#Events) that function similarly to lifecycle hooks, allowing developers to listen and respond to different stages and actions within the grid's lifecycle.

Here's a brief overview of some key events which can help in managing grid behavior, data manipulation, and user interactions:

### Source
- **`beforeanysource`**: Triggered before data application in [`data source`](./defs.md#Data-Source).
- **`afteranysource`**: Fires after all rows are updated.
- **`beforesourceset`**: Fired before [`data source`](./defs.md#Data-Source) application.
- **`aftersourceset`**: Occurs after rows are updated.
- **`beforetrimmed`**: Triggered before [`trimmed rows`](./defs.md#Trimmed-Rows) are applied.
- **`aftertrimmed`**: Notifies when [`trimmed rows`](./defs.md#Trimmed-Rows) is applied.

### Column
- **`beforecolumnapplied`**: Happens before columns are applied.
- **`beforecolumnsset`**: Triggered before column updates.
- **`aftercolumnsset`**: Fired when columns are updated.

### Edit
- **`beforeedit`**: Triggered before an edit is applied.
- **`beforerangeedit`**: Occurs before a range edit is applied.
- **`beforeautofill`**: Fired before autofill operation.
- **`afteredit`**: Executes after an edit action is completed.

### Focus/Selection
- **`beforecellfocus`**: Occurs before cell focus changes.
- **`beforefocuslost`**: Happens before grid focus is lost.
- **`afterfocus`**: Fires after focus render is completed.

Events provide a structured approach to handling RevoGrid's functionalities, making it easier to implement and manage complex data grid behaviors in web applications.
