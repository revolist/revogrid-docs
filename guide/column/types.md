## Column Formats

`<revo-grid/>` provides a way to define [your own editors](../cell/editor.md).

Yet it comes with plugins with different column types.
<br>All additional column types based on plugin idea:

-   They have to be imported to project in order to avoid extra data for users not interested in it;
-   You can create your own plugin types and refer to it. Just clone any existing type, it's simple as it is.

Check our [demo](/demo/) for live examples.

You can define your own plugins or use default one:

-   [String (default)](#String);
-   [Number](#Number);
-   [Select](#Select);
-   [Date](#Date).
