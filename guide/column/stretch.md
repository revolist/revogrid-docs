# Column Stretching in Data Grid

The Column Stretch feature allows you to automatically expand the last column ([or any, or all columns](./stretch.pro.md)) to fill any remaining space in your grid. This ensures that your grid fully utilizes the available width, providing a more polished and professional appearance.

## Enabling Column Stretch

To enable column stretching, simply set the `stretch` attribute to `"true"`. This will activate the feature, causing the last column to stretch and fill any unused space in the grid.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how to enable column stretching:

```html
<revo-grid stretch="true"></revo-grid>
```

### How It Works

With the `stretch` attribute enabled:

- The last column will automatically adjust its width to fill the remaining space in the grid.
- This feature is particularly useful when the total width of your columns doesn't match the width of the grid, ensuring that there are no gaps at the end.

### Benefits of Column Stretching

- **Improved Aesthetics**: The grid appears fully utilized, eliminating any unnecessary white space.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes or container widths, making your grid more flexible.
- **Simple Implementation**: Easily enable this feature with a single attribute, requiring no complex configuration.


## Conclusion

The Column Stretch feature is a simple yet effective way to enhance the layout of your grid by ensuring the last column always fills the available space. By using the `stretch="true"` attribute, you can create grids that look clean, professional, and responsive with minimal effort.
