# Advanced Column Stretching in RevoGrid Pro

Efficiently managing column widths in a data grid is crucial for creating a polished and user-friendly interface. The advanced column stretching feature in [Pro Version](../../pro), powered by the `ColumnStretchPlugin`, provides flexible options to ensure your grid fully utilizes the available space, adapting to various data presentation needs.

## What is Column Stretching?

Column stretching automatically adjusts the width of columns to fill the entire grid width. This is particularly useful when your grid has fewer columns than needed to enable a horizontal scrollbar, allowing the remaining space to be evenly distributed among the columns or according to specific rules.

### Stretch Configurations

RevoGrid Pro offers several stretch configurations through the `StretchConfig` type, enabling you to customize how the grid handles excess space:

- **`'none'`**: No column stretching is applied. Columns retain their default width.
- **`'last'`**: Only the last column stretches to fill the remaining space.
- **`'all'`**: All columns stretch evenly to fill the grid's width.
- **`number`**: A specific column (by index) is designated to stretch and fill the remaining width (For example column in the middle).

## Example: Implementing Column Stretching

Let's walk through an example where we set up a grid with three columns and use the `ColumnStretchPlugin` to stretch all columns to fit the grid's width.

```typescript

<!--@include: ../../demo/js/stretch.pro.ts-->

```

- Begin by importing the required modules, including the `ColumnStretchPlugin` and `defineCustomElements` from `revo-grid` and `revo-grid-pro`.
- Generate Random Data.
- Define the columns for your grid.
- Finally, configure the grid, set the data source, and apply the `ColumnStretchPlugin` to stretch the columns.

### Stretching Options

In the example above, `stretch: 'all'` ensures all columns stretch evenly to fit the grid width. You can adjust this to fit specific needs:

- **Stretch Only the Last Column**:
  ```javascript
  grid.additionalData = { stretch: 'last' };
  ```

- **Disable Stretching**:
  ```javascript
  grid.additionalData = { stretch: 'none' };
  ```

- **Stretch a Specific Column by Index**:
  ```javascript
  grid.additionalData = { stretch: 1 }; // Stretches the second column
  ```

## Conclusion

The `ColumnStretchPlugin` in RevoGrid Pro offers a powerful way to manage column widths dynamically, ensuring your grid looks clean and fully utilizes available space. Whether you need to stretch all columns or just a specific one, this plugin provides the flexibility to tailor your grid's layout to your exact requirements.
