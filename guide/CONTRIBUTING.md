## Reporting a Bug

* It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are encountering. Diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and not sustainable.

* The issue list of this repository is exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.

* Issues with no clear steps to reproduce will not be triaged.

* If you think you have found a bug, please check if it has already been [reported](https://github.com/revolist/revogrid/issues). You can search through existing issues and include closed ones as it may have been resolved.
    * If a bug report already exists, please upvote it using the :+1: reaction on the GitHub Issue summary to avoid "+1" comments.

* Next, [create a new issue](https://github.com/revolist/revogrid/issues/new) that thoroughly explains the problem.
    * Please fill out the issue form completely before submitting.
    * Please only include one bug per issue.

## Requesting a Feature

* Before requesting a feature, check if it has already been [proposed](https://github.com/revolist/revogrid/issues).
    * If a feature request already exists, please support it using the :+1: reaction on the GitHub Issue summary.

* Next, [create a new feature request](https://github.com/revolist/revogrid/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=feat%3A+) that thoroughly explains the desired feature.
    * Please fill out the feature request form completely before submitting.

Before submitting a pull request, please [create an issue](#reporting-a-bug) discussing the bug or feature request and indicate that you plan to work on it.
