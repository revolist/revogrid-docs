    * If a bug report already exists, please upvote it using the :+1: reaction on the GitHub Issue summary to avoid "+1" comments.

* Next, [create a new issue](https://github.com/revolist/revogrid/issues/new) that thoroughly explains the problem.
    * Please fill out the issue form completely before submitting.
    * Please only include one bug per issue.
