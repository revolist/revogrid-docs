# Single file bundle

RevoGrid also offers a single file bundle without the polyfills and other additional functionality included in the default output.

You would need additional dependency to load RevoGrid as standalone esm module.

::: code-group

```npm
npm i @stencil/core

```

```pnpm
pnpm add @stencil/core
```

```yarn
yarn add @stencil/core
```

```bun
bun add @stencil/core
```
:::

Now you can import `RevoGrid` into your app:

```js
import { defineCustomElement } from "@revolist/revogrid/standalone";

// A utility defineCustomElement() function is exported from esm file of the output directory.
// This function can be used to quickly define all RevoGrid components in a project on the custom elements registry.
defineCustomElement();

import { defineCustomElement as defineFilterPanel } from '@revolist/revogrid/standalone/revogr-filter-panel.js';
// Filter is defined as a standalone component plugin and should be imported here
defineFilterPanel?.();
```

Please note that this standalone output does not automatically define the custom elements or apply any polyfills which is why weâ€™re defining the custom element above ourselves.

For more details, please see [Stencil.js documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/custom-elements).
