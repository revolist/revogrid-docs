Applications using RevoGrid may need to pass security tests before production deployment. RevoGrid is tested for a variety of security vulnerabilities using the SonarQube automatic security testing tool. SonarQube evaluates security using well-established standards such as CWE, SANS Top 25, and OWASP Top 10.

### SonarQube Results

The SonarQube security test results for our main NPM packages are available, ensuring that RevoGrid maintains high security standards.
