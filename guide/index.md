# What's `revo-grid` is all about?

 Let's say you've got a ton of data to display on your web app. It's all about letting you throw in loads of data and manipulate it any way you fancyâ€”without breaking a sweat. Read more about how and why you should use it in our [Overview section](./overview).

This method is perfect for prototypes, quick projects, or just getting a feel of what it can do. Directly include `revo-grid` in your HTML file to get started.

Embed the library using a script tag in the `<head>` section of your `index.html`. This loads the `revo-grid` webcomponent, making it available throughout your document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@revolist/Revogrid@latest/dist/revo-grid/revo-grid.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <revo-grid style="height: 200px"/>
</body>
</html>
  
```


Once you've integrated grid into your `html`, the next step is to breathe life into it. It's as simple as defining your grid's structure and feeding it the data it's meant to display:
