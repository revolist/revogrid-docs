# Auto-Focus on Next Line in Data Grids

The Auto-Focus on Next Line [Pro Version](../pro) plugin is designed to streamline user interaction within the grid by automatically moving the focus to the next row when the user reaches the last cell of the current row. This feature significantly improves the efficiency of data entry and editing tasks by reducing the need for manual navigation between rows.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Navigation**: As soon as the user navigates to the last cell in a row, the focus seamlessly shifts to the first cell of the next row. This allows for continuous data entry without interruptions.
  
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: By automating row transitions, this plugin minimizes the repetitive actions typically required to move from one row to the next, thus speeding up the data entry process.
  
- **Configurable Behavior**: The plugin offers customization options that allow developers to tailor the focus behavior to meet the specific needs of their application and users.

## Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: This feature simplifies grid navigation, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. Users can focus on entering data rather than managing navigation, leading to a smoother experience.
  
- **Increased Productivity**: By automating the movement between rows, the plugin helps users complete data entry tasks more quickly, boosting overall productivity.
