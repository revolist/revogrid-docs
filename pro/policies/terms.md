## Part 3: Service Plans and Platform

### 7. Service Plans

1. The Services to be provided by Revolist under this Service Agreement are set forth in the description of the RevoGrid Pro Plan selected by the User.

2. Regarding individual Services that are mentioned in the Service Plans offered by Revolist, the following shall apply based on service plan offer:

   a) **Access to Pro Examples:** Pro Examples are advanced examples built on top of the RevoGrid library. The User may access the source code of all Pro Examples for the term of the Service Agreement. Once the Service Agreement ends, the User will no longer have access to the source code of the Pro Examples. Revolist may add, update, change, or remove Pro Examples during the term of the Service Agreement. The source code of the Pro Examples can be copied, adapted, and reused by the User from the start of the Service Agreement for an unlimited amount of time. However, the source code of the Pro Examples is not allowed for redistribution, repackaging, or for building similar services as RevoGrid Pro. The Pro Examples are provided on the RevoGrid Pro website. The code is embedded in the website and can be copied to the User's environment. Revolist is not liable for the provided source code or any of its dependencies. Revolist does not guarantee that the code will work in the User's environment. The primary language for all examples provided within RevoGrid Pro is `JavaScript/TypeScript`. Framework-oriented examples, including but not limited to Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks, are secondary to the primary examples and can be made available at a later time. The release schedule for these framework-specific examples may vary, and they will be provided as supplementary resources to enhance the utility of RevoGrid Pro across various development environments. While we strive to support a broad range of frameworks, we do not guarantee the immediate availability of examples for any specific framework other than JavaScript/TypeScript. Users are encouraged to utilize the primary examples in the interim or adapt them as needed for their framework of choice.

   b) **Prioritized GitHub Issues:** Revolist is committed to resolving issues in the RevoGrid library. During the term of the Service Agreement, the User may submit GitHub issues and forward them to Revolist via email ([contact@revolist.eu](mailto:contact@revolist.eu)). Revolist does not guarantee that the issue will be resolved but will prioritize responding to the GitHub issues of subscribed users.

   c) **Individual Support via Email:** The User can raise support requests via the provided email address on the RevoGrid Pro website. The User will have the chance to address questions to Revolist’s experts and exchange messages with them. Revolist aims to respond to the User's support request within 48 hours on weekdays. Requests made on weekends and on public holidays in Estonia will be responded to within 48 hours from the next working day. Revolist does not represent or warrant that it will answer questions or provide solutions or workarounds for any potential bug, insufficiency, or malfunction of RevoGrid, nor does it commit to performing any kind of repairs to RevoGrid. Support is limited to one hour per month per User. Unused support time cannot be transferred and expires at the end of each month.

   d) **Introduction Call:** The User is entitled to a 15-minute online video or voice call with a Revolist expert within four weeks after the conclusion of the Service Agreement. For the scheduling of the call within the aforementioned period, Revolist will make at least three suggestions, considering the availability of its team. The call is scheduled and held via a third-party service (e.g., cal.com). Revolist is not liable for any services provided by third-party platforms or for any terms of service provided by these third-party platforms.

### 8. Fees and Payments

1. The RevoGrid Pro Plan is subject to a fee. The fees to be paid under the Service Agreement correspond to the fees for the RevoGrid Pro Plan selected by the User.

2. The due date and the payment methods accepted by Revolist are determined by the description of the Service Plan selected by the User, which is subject to this Service Agreement. In case of doubt, the fees for a specific booked period are due in advance.

3. Fees are always shown exclusive as well as inclusive of VAT.

4. In the event of default, the User shall pay default interest to Revolist in accordance with the statutory provisions applicable in Estonia. Further rights of Revolist shall remain unaffected.

5. The User agrees to electronic invoicing.

6. **Trial and Evaluation**: Revolist provides a trial version of RevoGrid Pro for evaluation purposes. Trial access is granted upon request and requires direct contact with Revolist. By purchasing RevoGrid Pro, the User acknowledges they have had the opportunity to evaluate the service through the trial platform and understand the service capabilities before purchase. To request trial access, contact Revolist at [contact@revolist.eu](mailto:contact@revolist.eu).

### 9. Availability of the Platform

1. The availability of the Platform is determined as follows:
   a) Revolist will perform the required maintenance work on the Platform between 02:00 a.m. and 06:00 a.m. (CET) ("Maintenance Windows"). During Maintenance Windows, the Platform may be temporarily unavailable on the internet, either entirely or with respect to certain Services.
   b) Revolist makes the Platform available on the internet for at least 99 percent of the time per calendar quarter. The times of the Maintenance Windows shall not be included in the calculation of the availability.
   c) Revolist may limit access to the Platform even outside the Maintenance Windows if this is necessary for the security of the Platform's operation or the preservation of network integrity or user data, especially to avoid serious malfunctions of the network, the software, or stored data.

2. The point of handover/delivery relevant for the availability of the Platform is the interface between the servers on which the Platform is hosted and the internet.

### 10. Updates and Changes to Platform Functionalities

In the interest of all Users, Revolist endeavors to continuously improve the Platform and expand it in a meaningful way in order to continually increase its benefits for its Users. Therefore, Revolist expressly reserves the right to further develop the Platform during the term of the Service Agreement. As part of the further development, Revolist may, for example, change the appearance of the frontend or backend, modify, add, and remove functions, and change designs, input screens, and other elements of the frontend and backend (collectively referred to as "Platform Updates"). The User shall not have any claim to Platform Updates or to continued use of a certain version of the Platform. The User cannot derive any claims against Revolist due to the implementation of Platform Updates if and insofar as (i) no functions which are contractually guaranteed to the User are canceled or impaired by the Platform Updates and (ii) the User does not suffer any unacceptable disadvantages due to Platform Updates.

## Part 4: Legal Terms

### 11. Data Protection

Revolist strictly complies with the regulations of applicable data protection legislation. Please find Revolist’s Privacy Policy at [Privacy Policy](./privacy).

### 12. General Limitation of Liability

Revolist shall be liable exclusively according to the following regulations, no matter what the legal basis may be.

1. Revolist shall only be liable for intent and gross negligence. In the event of slight negligence, Revolist shall be liable only in the case of a breach of a material contractual obligation whose fulfillment is essential to the due performance of the Agreement and on whose fulfillment the User may rely (cardinal obligation). In this context, Revolist shall be liable only for foreseeable damage whose occurrence must typically be expected. This also applies to lost profit and unrealized savings.

2. The aforementioned limitation of liability of Revolist shall not apply in the event of injury to life, body and/or health and in the case of liability under any applicable product liability legislation.

3. Revolist shall not be liable for any events of force majeure that make contractual performance impossible, even if such events merely impair the due performance of the Agreement to a significant extent or hinder it temporarily. Force majeure comprises all circumstances that are independent of the will and influence of the contracting Parties, such as terror attacks, embargo, confiscation, natural disasters, strikes, official orders, or measures to the public, including but not limited to those to avert hazards or health risks, including measures addressing a pandemic or other serious and unforeseeable circumstances for which the contracting Parties are not responsible. In this context, a circumstance will be regarded as force majeure only if it occurs after the conclusion of the Service Agreement.

4. Moreover, Revolist shall not be liable for malfunctions and loss of quality of the data transfer on the Internet for which Revolist is not responsible and that impairs or prevents the use of functions of the Platform or Services.

5. To the extent that the liability of Revolist is excluded or limited, this shall also apply to the liability of the employees, other staff members, representatives, and agents of Revolist.

6. RevoGrid Pro incorporates third-party tools and libraries within its samples, plugins, and examples. We take care to ensure that these tools are licensed under permissive licenses such as the MIT License, GPL License, Apache 2.0, or similar, which generally allow for commercial usage. However, it is the responsibility of the customer to verify that these third-party tools are compatible with their specific needs and legal requirements. A detailed list of the third-party tools and libraries utilized within RevoGrid Pro, along with their respective licenses, can be found at [3rdparty](./3rdparty).
7. **Future Inclusion of Libraries:** We reserve the right to incorporate additional third-party libraries in future examples or plugins provided within RevoGrid Pro. Customers are encouraged to review the licenses of any included third-party tools to ensure they meet their specific requirements.
8. **Customer Responsibility:** While we endeavor to use reputable third-party tools with permissive licenses, customers should independently verify that the included tools and their licenses align with their intended use and comply with their legal obligations.

### 13. Subcontractors, Assignment of Rights and Obligations

1. The transfer of rights and obligations under this Service Agreement by the User to third parties is subject to the express prior approval of Revolist.

2. Revolist may delegate its service obligations from the Service Agreement to third parties or subcontractors and transfer claims against the User to third parties. Vis-à-vis the User, Revolist will remain responsible for the contractual performance.

### 14. Offsetting

The User may only offset Revolist’s claims against the User with undisputed claims or claims legally confirmed by a court. This shall not apply to claims that exist vis-à-vis the Parties within the scope of contracts concluded between Revolist and the User on the basis of mutuality.

### 15. Amendments to these Terms of Use

1. Revolist may amend these Terms of Use and other applicable contractual provisions:
   a) if they need to be adapted to applicable law, especially if the relevant legal situation changes;
   b) if this is required for Revolist to comply with a court order or an official decision that is binding for Revolist;
   c) if the amendments are merely advantageous for the User; or
   d) due to unforeseeable changes that are not caused by Revolist and over which Revolist does not have any influence and that disturb the balance that existed at the conclusion of the Agreement to an extent that is not insignificant.

2. Amendments as defined in the preceding paragraph (1) will be offered to the User no later than one month prior to the proposed effective date in textual form or in writing, e.g., via email. The User’s approval will be deemed granted if the User does not indicate its rejection of the amendments before the proposed effective date of the amendments. In its offer for amendment of the Terms of Use, Revolist will highlight all amendments and will expressly draw attention to the approval effect as of the proposed effective date.

### 16. Entrepreneur and Consumer Information

1. The following shall apply to entrepreneurs: Section 47(1) of the Estonian Law of Obligations Act (Võlaõigusseadus) shall not apply.

Trial access requires direct contact with Revolist at [contact@revolist.eu](mailto:contact@revolist.eu). Withdrawal rights may be limited due to immediate digital delivery and prior evaluation opportunity.


3. The User shall be sent the contractual provisions, including these Terms of Use and—if the User is a consumer—the cancellation policy with the confirmation email specified in § 4 of these Terms of Use. The User may download these documents to their computer and/or print them out and keep them. Revolist will not store the contractual provisions for the User.

4. The contract language is English, and all declarations and communication shall take place in the English language.

### 17. Miscellaneous

1. All headings in these Terms of Use are provided for convenience and readability only and have no influence on the meaning and interpretation of the individual provisions.

2. As far as this is permitted by the applicable laws, the Service Agreement and all contracts concluded between Revolist and its Users shall be governed by Estonian law, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).

3. If the User is a merchant, Entrepreneur, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law, or if the User has no general place of jurisdiction in Estonia, disputes arising from or in connection with the Service Agreement and all contracts concluded between Revolist and its Users are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts at the registered office of Revolist (currently Tallinn, Estonia).

4. Should individual provisions of the Service Agreement, these Terms of Use, or of contracts or agreements concluded between the Parties be fully or partially invalid or unenforceable or become invalid or unenforceable after the conclusion of the respective contract, this shall not affect the validity of the other provisions. Instead, the Parties shall endeavor to agree on a substitute regulation that comes as close as possible to the effects of the invalid or unenforceable regulation in a legally permissible and economic way. The aforesaid provisions shall also apply in case any provisions should turn out to have gaps.
