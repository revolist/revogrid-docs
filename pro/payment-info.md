::: details Perpetual vs. Annual Licenses  {open}

Both license types allow you to keep using any version released before your license term ends for production deployments.

The key difference lies in development rights:
- Perpetual License: Continue development even after your license expires.
- Annual License: Requires an active license to keep developing.

You can learn more about this in the [EULA](./policies/license.md#_3-7-License-model).

::: details Annual license model {open}

An Annual License gives you access to all the tools and updates while it’s active.
When the term ends, you can still use your deployed versions in production, but development will require renewal.
If you’re planning to pause development, there’s no need to renew.

You can learn more about this in the [EULA](./policies/license.md#_3-7-License-model).
